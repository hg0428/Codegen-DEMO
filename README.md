## Replit GhostWriter (Kinda like copilot) for free????‚ùî
Only problem, it's not built into the editor. 
You can use this model to generate code for you.

### About
This is an example of how to use Codegen.

### Customization
Adjust the values in generate.py to optimize the AI for what you need. If you have enough storage, try loading one of the bigger models. 

Training is currently not available, but I will update this template as soon as I figure that out.
