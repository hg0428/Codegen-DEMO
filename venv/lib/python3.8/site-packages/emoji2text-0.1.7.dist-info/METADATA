Emoji2Text
==========

Take a string with emoji in it. Convert them into their text based
names.

.. code:: python

    from emoji2text import emoji2text

    emoji2text("""
    Take a 🎁 of emoji like 🥑, 😞 or 🤮
    and convert them to 🔠 🔡
    and you'll be feeling all
    🙌🏾 💪🏻 👩‍🔬 👨‍💻 💯 🎊!
    """)
    # Take a wrapped gift of emoji like avocado, disappointed face or face vomiting
    # and convert them to input latin uppercase input latin lowercase
    # and you'll be feeling all
    # raising hands: medium-dark skin tone flexed biceps: light skin tone woman scientist man technologist hundred points confetti ball!

You can also wrap them to help differenciate each emoji like so:

.. code:: python

    emoji2text("😀😂😂😎", ":")
    # :grinning face::face with tears of joy::face with tears of joy::smiling face with sunglasses:

    emoji2text("😀😂😂😎", "<", ">")
    # <grinning face><face with tears of joy><face with tears of joy><smiling face with sunglasses>

To install, use ``pip``

::

    pip install emoji2text

Only supports Python 3 and emoji version 5.0 (2017). If someone is
interested in increasing support I’d be happy to look at any PR.

If you spot any errors, please create an issue with a failing input and
expected result.

Only possible thanks to the very helpful
`grapheme <https://github.com/alvinlindstam/grapheme>`__ module.
